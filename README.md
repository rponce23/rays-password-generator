# Javascript Password Generator

## Description

This is the Third Challenge in which I generated in Javascript a password generator.
I did it applying a function to each process to generate the password according to the criteria.
I learnt how to apply a button to run a JS program and how to display a result in a specific area on the page.

## Updates

1. I did the correction of the error:
 "The password that is generated doesn't reflect the options the user chooses. For example, if a user only selects numbers the password generated also includes lowercased, uppercased, and special characters". 
 This error was corrrected by adding the options array in blank at the begining of the create() function.

 2. Added the recommended file/folder structure with CSS and JS in an assets folder
